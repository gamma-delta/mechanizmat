### Innovation is king

Welcome to Mechanizmat! This is a discord bot I'm working on to practice my game design and Go skills. (Currently, the bot is private, as this is still VERY in beta.) 

In-game, you construct and customize entirely modular steam-powered mechas and fight other players in turn-based one-on-one combat, like Pokemon.

If you want some more information about the project, why not read the [in-game newspaper, the Mechanizmat Metropolitan][docs/index.md]?
